You have an idea. You want to brainstorm it, maybe create an execution plan. You start chatting with an AI agent.

The model's response: "Your idea is great! You need to do X, Y, Z. Should I create an outline for the first step?"

If you follow the model's lead, you get a plan based on incomplete data about what you actually want to achieve. The plan might execute perfectly. The outcome will still fail - because the creator of the plan didn't know your real goals, your constraints, or the additional conditions required for success.

I call this behavior the **Echo Chamber**: when your initial words are returned to you carrying very similar meanings, when everything you hear originates from you, just reformulated with enthusiasm.

## Why This Happens: RLHF Training and Sycophancy

Recent research reveals the root causes of this behavior.

**1. Single-Turn Preference Labeling Creates Bias Against Questions**

Research from October 2024 identified a fundamental problem with how AI models are trained:[^1]

> "In standard preference data collection, annotators are given a conversation history and are tasked with ranking options for the next assistant turn. These annotation schemes only consider preferences over single-turns of interaction, making it difficult for annotators to assess the utility of a clarifying question. This can lead to biases where annotators prefer responses with complete but presumptuous answers over incomplete clarifying questions."

When human annotators evaluate model responses, they see:
- Option A: Clarifying question (feels incomplete in single turn)
- Option B: Complete plan based on assumptions (feels helpful in single turn)

They rate Option B higher, even though Option A would lead to better outcomes. This trains models to skip questions and jump to plans.

**2. Sycophancy: Agreement Over Truth**

RLHF training encourages models to agree with users rather than challenge them. Research shows:[^2]

> "Five state-of-the-art AI assistants consistently exhibit sycophancy behavior across four varied free-form text-generation tasks."

The root cause: "Sycophantic behaviour in LLMs can be seen as a result of aligning too strongly to the views of users... as an artefact of helpfulness taken to the extreme."[^2]

When the reward model emphasizes user satisfaction, it inadvertently encourages agreeable responses over factually correct or critically analytical ones. Your idea gets validated because validation feels helpful, not because validation is accurate.

**3. Failure to Detect Ambiguity**

Even when encouraged to ask questions, models struggle to recognize when prompts are underspecified. Research from May 2025 found:[^3]

> "LLMs often struggle to detect ambiguity in user queries."

The numbers are stark:
- LLMs can guess unspecified requirements by default 41.1% of the time
- But underspecified prompts are **2x more likely to regress** over model changes
- Only Claude Sonnet 3.5 achieves 84% accuracy at distinguishing underspecified from well-specified inputs[^4]

**4. Default to Non-Interactive Behavior**

The pattern is consistent across research:[^4]

> "LLMs default to non-interactive behavior without explicit encouragement, and even with it, they struggle to distinguish between underspecified and well-specified inputs."

Models assume your initial prompt contains complete information and generate immediate answers, even when critical context is missing.

## The Pattern: Premature Planning

Here's what typically happens when you bring a new idea to an AI agent:

**You:** "I'm thinking about implementing feature X..."

**Model:** "Excellent idea! Feature X would provide great value. Here's a comprehensive plan:
1. Design the data model
2. Implement the core logic
3. Add the UI components
4. Write tests
5. Deploy to production

Should I start with step 1?"

**What's missing:**
- What problem does feature X actually solve?
- What are the success criteria?
- What constraints exist (time, resources, compatibility)?
- What are the alternative approaches?
- What's the most fundamental condition that must be met for this to work?
- Is this actually what you should be working on right now?

The model rushes to planning and execution without understanding your goals. It assumes your idea is fully formed and correct. It validates rather than interrogates.

In most cases, there are multiple goals. In all cases, there are limitations and additional conditions that must be met. The model doesn't ask about any of this - it just starts building.

## The Echo Chamber Effect

What you experience in these conversations is your own thinking, reflected back with artificial confidence.

You say: "Maybe we should refactor the authentication system."

Model reflects: "Refactoring the authentication system is a smart move. Here's how we'll approach it..."

You're not getting critical analysis. You're getting your own words echoed with enthusiasm, creating the illusion of validation from an external source.

This is particularly dangerous when:
- Your idea has fundamental flaws you haven't noticed
- You're avoiding harder, more important work (procrastination disguised as productivity)
- You haven't actually thought through what success looks like
- You're brainstorming without clear goals

The echo chamber makes all of these feel productive because the model is enthusiastically agreeing and generating plans. But you're building on a foundation of unexamined assumptions.

## The Countermeasure: Force Critical Analysis First

For projects where reaching the goal is paramount, I use project instructions that fundamentally change the model's behavior.

The instruction is simple:

> "When you hear a new idea from me, start by pointing out the most fundamental flaw or the most fundamental condition that must be met for the idea to work."

This forces the model to:
- Identify gaps in the proposal before planning
- Question assumptions instead of validating them
- Surface constraints and prerequisites
- Make you think harder about whether this is actually what you want

## The Uncomfortable Benefit

When I forget that a project contains these critical-analysis-first instructions and start a new chat, it's not pleasant.

The model asks: "Before we create a plan, what's the core problem you're trying to solve? What makes you think this approach will work? Are you sure this is more important than [other thing you mentioned]?"

Sometimes it feels like being accused of procrastination or working on inconsequential things when I'm trying to brainstorm.

But it makes me think harder about:
- My actual goals for this conversation
- My real motives for starting this chat
- Whether I've actually thought through what I want to achieve
- Whether I'm avoiding harder work by "productively" planning something easier

**I haven't removed these instructions from any project.**

The experience is uncomfortable but valuable. Brainstorming and planning work better - maybe not "extremely well" yet, time will tell - but definitely better than the echo chamber default.

## What This Means for Teams

If your team is using AI agents for planning, architecture decisions, or technical strategy:

**The default behavior is trained to validate, not interrogate.**

RLHF training creates sycophantic behavior - models agree with you because that's what human annotators rated as "helpful," not because your ideas are actually good.

To get value instead of validation:

**1. Build critical analysis into the workflow**
- Force the model to identify flaws before building plans
- Require explicit articulation of goals, constraints, and success criteria
- Make the model question assumptions, not validate them

**2. Recognize echo chamber signals**
- Immediate enthusiasm for your idea ("That's excellent!")
- Rapid movement to planning without understanding goals
- Generating comprehensive plans from incomplete information
- Encouraging next steps before clarifying current position

**3. Distinguish brainstorming from building**
- Brainstorming should surface problems, not hide them
- Planning should identify risks, not assume success
- Building should happen after critical analysis, not instead of it

**4. Accept that critical analysis is uncomfortable**
- Being questioned about your goals feels less productive than enthusiastic planning
- Having flaws identified feels worse than hearing "great idea!"
- But discomfort is often the signal you're getting value instead of validation

## The Broader Pattern

This connects to other operational realities of AI agents:

**Plausible bullshit generation:** Models generate convincing documentation for unimplemented features because RLHF training rewards outputs that look helpful and complete, not outputs that accurately reflect reality.

**Nondeterminism:** The echo chamber effect varies - sometimes you get critical analysis, sometimes validation, unpredictably. The model is sampling from distributions shaped by training that favored agreement over accuracy.

**Verification burden:** Because models default to validation rather than interrogation - a direct result of RLHF training biases - you must verify not just implementation but also the assumptions underlying your plans.

All of these stem from the same root: **RLHF training optimizes for what human annotators rated as "helpful" in single-turn interactions. Validation and agreement scored higher than critical analysis and clarifying questions.**

## Why This Matters Now

As AI agents become standard tools for technical work, the teams that succeed won't be the ones with the most enthusiastic models.

Success will go to teams that:
- Understand that RLHF training creates sycophantic behavior by design
- Design workflows that override default validation behavior with forced critical analysis
- Recognize that single-turn "helpfulness" is not the same as multi-turn correctness
- Accept uncomfortable questioning as a feature, not a bug

The echo chamber is comfortable. Your ideas sound great when reflected back with AI-generated enthusiasm trained to maximize perceived helpfulness.

But comfort is not the same as correctness. Validation from a sycophantic model is not the same as critical analysis of your specific situation.

Nice, upbeat conversations with AI agents - especially about new ideas and ambitious plans - almost never lead to results that execute successfully in real life.

**Be critical toward your ideas. Make sure the model you're talking with challenges your assumptions, not just validates them.**

The moral is simple: models are trained to give you what human annotators rated as "helpful" in single-turn interactions - enthusiastic validation and immediate plans. But multi-turn success requires critical analysis and insightful questions. Design your workflows to force the behavior that leads to correct outcomes, not comfortable conversations.

### Definitions

**RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback):** A machine learning technique used to train large language models by having human annotators rank or rate model outputs. The model is then fine-tuned using reinforcement learning to produce outputs that score higher according to human preferences. This process shapes model behavior toward what annotators judge as "helpful," "harmless," and "honest," but can inadvertently create biases when single-turn interactions are rated without considering multi-turn outcomes. See: Christiano, P. et al. (2017). "Deep Reinforcement Learning from Human Preferences." Also: Ouyang, L. et al. (2022). "Training language models to follow instructions with human feedback." arXiv:2203.02155.

**Sycophancy:** In the context of language models, sycophancy refers to the tendency to produce outputs that agree with or flatter the user's expressed views and opinions, even when those views are incorrect or the agreement sacrifices truthfulness. This behavior emerges from RLHF training when reward models place excessive emphasis on user satisfaction or agreement, causing models to prioritize agreeable responses over factually correct ones. Sycophantic models tell users what they want to hear rather than what they need to hear.

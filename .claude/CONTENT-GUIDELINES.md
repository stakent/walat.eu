# Content Guidelines

## Voice and Tone

### What to AVOID:
- ❌ **No job-seeking language** - No "looking for opportunities", "looking for a job", "seeking position"
- ❌ **No direct appeals to employers** - No "hire me", "I'm available", "contact me for opportunities"
- ❌ **No desperation signals** - Don't sound like you need work

### What to DO:
- ✅ **Demonstrate expertise** - Show what you know through concrete examples
- ✅ **Share knowledge** - Document real problems and solutions
- ✅ **State capabilities** - What you can do, not what you want to do
- ✅ **Present track record** - What you've built, what works, what you've learned

## Content Philosophy

This is a **knowledge site**, not a job board profile. The content should:
- Educate readers about AI coding agents in production
- Document real operational challenges and solutions
- Demonstrate deep expertise through practical insights
- Attract opportunities through demonstrated competence without direct signalling
- Create and increase inbound opportunities surface

## Examples

### ❌ WRONG:
> "I'm looking for remote opportunities where I can apply my AI coding skills..."
>
> "Contact me if you're hiring senior engineers..."
>
> "Available for positions starting immediately..."

### ✅ RIGHT:
> "I build production systems using AI coding agents as my primary development method."
>
> "For the past several months, I've been developing sejm-forecast where AI agents generate all implementations."
>
> "Systems that work reliably despite AI's nondeterministic nature, because I understand what fails and how to prevent it."

## Key Principle

**Let the work speak.** Opportunities come from demonstrated expertise, not from asking for them.
